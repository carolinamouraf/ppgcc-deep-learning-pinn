  Melisa Enrico, of the University of Arizona, held a temperature probe firmly between her thumb and forefinger while the temperature T of the probe was recorded at time t every two seconds over a 20 second interval.  This shows a numerical approximation for dT/dt (second column) as a function of the temperature T.
