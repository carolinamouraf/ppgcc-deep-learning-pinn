A subject was shown a 400 sq cm square and advised that its area was assigned the number 20 units as area.  The subject was then given various numbers and asked to draw a squares with those numbers as the area when compared to the 20 units area.  This shows the result of such an experiment where the first column is the physical area of the object in sq cm, and the second column is the judged area of the object.
