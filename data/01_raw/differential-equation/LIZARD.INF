  Experiments have been performed where a
lizard is encouraged to run as fast as possible, starting from rest.  The distance run
in meters (second column) is then measured as a function of time in seconds (first column).


  Data from "Effects of body size and slope on acceleration of a lizard (Stellio Stellio)" by R.B. Huey and P.E. Hertz, J. Exp. Biol., Volume 110, 1984, 113-123.
