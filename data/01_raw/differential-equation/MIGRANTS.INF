  In order to measure the probability of
nonseasonal migrant workers settling in the USA, the life histories of 271 male household heads were collected.  This shows the number of migrants remaining (second column) as a function of the number of years of their US experience (first column).

  Data from "Immigration Statistics" by D. B. Levine, K. Hill, and R. Warren (editors), National Academy Press, 1985, page 269 and Table C-7, page 290.
