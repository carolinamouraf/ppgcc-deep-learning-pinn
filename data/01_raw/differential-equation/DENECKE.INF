  Paul Denecke, University of Arizona, conducted the following experiment using a VCR equipped with a digital tape-counter.  He put a tape in the unit, set the tapecounter to zero, and, as he started the tape playing, noted the time.  He then kept recording the time and the number on the tapecounter.  This data set was obtained in this way.  It shows the number of revolutions - the number on the tapecounter - (second column) as a function of time in seconds (first column).
