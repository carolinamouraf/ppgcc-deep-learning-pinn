This shows the result of an experiment in which 10 subjects were briefly exposed to a bright light, causing their pupils to dilate, and then the diameter of each pupil in millimeters was measured every 0.5 seconds as the pupil expanded.  (The second column is the average eye diameter of the 10 subjects.)
