Very high energy particles are found in the radiation belts of Earth, Jupiter, and Saturn.  During Pioneer 10's flyby of Jupiter in 1973, these data were obtained.  It shows the number of particles per unit time (second column) at different energies (first column) in Jupiter's radiation belt and is called a spectrum.
