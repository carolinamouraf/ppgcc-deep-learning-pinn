Here are some data on an outbreak of the gypsy moth, which devastated forests in Massachusetts in the US.  Rather than count the number of moths, the number of acres defoliated by the moths was counted.  

This data was supplied by Chuck Schwalbe, U.S. Dept of Agriculture to the Exploring Data website at http://curriculum.qed.qld.gov.au/kla/eda/.
