A subject was given some objects and asked to judge their weights where a 98 gram object was assigned the value 100.  This shows the result of such an experiment where the first column is the physical weight of the object in grams, and the second column is the judged weight of the object.  (This is an example of a "judgment of magnitude" experiment )
