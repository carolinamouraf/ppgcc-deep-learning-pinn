  A spring-mass-spring system with various masses was allowed to oscillate with no friction or gravity.  This shows the period in seconds of the oscillations (second column) as a function of the mass in kg (first column). 

  This experiment was conducted by David Harman and Mark Zerella, students at the University of Arizona.
